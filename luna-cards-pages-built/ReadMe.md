This folder contains the html scaffolds used to create the basic page layouts for some of the pages on lunacards.com.au.

Please read below for more context.

## Business Requirements
The business already had been operating a physical store for almost 9 months though due to being ghosted by a pervious developer I was brought in to help get the site up and operational. There was only one product type available on the site and the rest of the pages were coming soon landing pages.

#### Requirements
- Create Play, In-store & Live Streams Page.
- Edit and update Contact-Us & Grading Page.
- Clean up and prepare the shopify site for the listing of more products asap.

The goal was to quickly put together the scaffold and help craft the language on each of the new pages required by the business and begin listing items to the store.

## Solution
Due to this the layout and format of the pages created are fairly simple. The business directives were to get the site up and operational then continue to update and develop going forward.
